# Don-t-Break-Traffic-Rules-automatic-Detection-of-Helmet-and-Number-Plate-extraction-from-videos-or-i
Don’t Break Traffic Rules is basically a small yet massive background application model, which allows the users to detect and even capture the riders riding their vehicle without wearing helmet. So obviously yolo has been used to perform this type of task, since due to its scalability and efficiency it detects the objects in an image or video accurately, since it was manually trained on 1000’s of images to perform this task. Along with yolo we have also used OpenCV and Tkinter gui to build a front-end framework.
